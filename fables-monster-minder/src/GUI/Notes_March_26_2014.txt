Attack Monster button brings up a new window with options of types of attack.
They input the values into the entries and then click button to attack monster.
This button will call damageMonster() which takes parameters:
	attackType atk_type,
	int baseDMG,
	int monsterDEF, (the monster info will be pulled from a monsterstate)
	int monsterARM,
	int monsterRES
	int roll (damage roll),
	weaponType wpn_type
	
Attack panel/window that pops up has the following entries:

baseDMG_entry
element_dropdown_menu
monsterDEF_entry (default value is the monster's DEF pulled from the monsterstate and displayed)
monsterARM_entry (default value is from monsterstate)
monsterRES_entry (default value is from monsterstate)

note: empty entry handling will need to be had

MonsterFrame should have a notebook with two tabs, one is Monster Data and one is Edit Monster.
Edit Monster tab should have a button labled "Update Monster" which will update the selected
monster with new data.

Currently MonsterFrame contains a MonsterTabs called *notebook. MonsterTabs will be a class
that creates a GtkWidget notebook using gtk_notebook_new
