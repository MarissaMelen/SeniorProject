\begin{itemize}
\item Date: 2013-10-30
\item Project Title: Fables of Slyvus (C) Monster Minder
\item Team Members: Ryan Nish, Victor Aw, Marissa Melen
\item Completed Work: We have finished creating diagrams for our
  requirements documents. We have also determined and enumerated the
  game rules relevant to this project.
\item Psuedocode was not written due to one of our members falling ill
  and the additional work of determining the precise rules which
  govern the monsters.
\item There were no changes in scope.
\item Next Phase: We will continue to work on implementation and write pseudocode.
\item Anticipated Challenges: While it is unlikely, we may encounter
  challenges in how we can implement the features of our project.
\end{itemize}
\item Our current plan is to begin coding.
\item Current project artifacts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proposal: We have included the proposal 
\item Analysis documents: We have an analysis document, in LaTeX format
\item Design documents: We have included the feature list and game
  rules governing our project.
