\item Date: 2014-1-30
\item Project Title: Fables of Slyvus $^{\small \copyright}$ Monster Minder
\item Team Members: Ryan Nish, Victor Aw, Marissa Melen
\item Completed Work: We have update the design document wording to
  accurately reflect the proposed design.
  Skeleton code for monster creation, and turn order functionality.  Monster attacking functions plotted.
\item There were no tasks that were not completed.
\item There were no changes in scope.
\item Next Phase: Completing functions for the monster generation and turn running.  Monster attacking functions finished.
\item Anticipated Challenges: Proper turn order functionality.  
Monster attcking might not run smoothly for the different attacking types.
\end{itemize}
\item Currently coding the monster generating portion of the code, the turn functionality, and the monster attacking.
\item Current project artifacts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Proposal: We have included the proposal 
\item Analysis documents: We have an analysis document, in LaTeX format
\item Design documents: We have included the feature list and game
  rules governing our project, as well as a formal design document.
\item Source code: None right now
\item There are no other essential artifacts
